Hangman Game in C:

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. The program selects a random word from a predefined file, and players attempt to guess it one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess progresses the hangman illustration toward completion. The objective is to guess the word before reaching seven incorrect guesses.

2.Utilizes a linked list for efficient word management
<br>
3.Randomly selects a word for each session
<br>
4.Displays a hangman illustration based on incorrect guesses
<br>
5.Tracks player progress and determines win/loss conditions

3.The player enters a letter as a guess.
<br>
4.Correct guesses reveal corresponding letters, while incorrect guesses contribute to the hangman drawing.
